# Food Image Classification App

## Project Overview
This project is a machine learning application built using Streamlit. The application classifies food images using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The application allows users to upload images, processes these images to predict their food category, and provides interactive elements such as sliders and text inputs.

## Features
- **Media Display**: Upload and display image files.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Convert uploaded images to RGB, resize them, and normalize pixel values.
- **Model Prediction**: Use a pre-trained model to predict the food category of the uploaded image.
- **Progress Indicator**: Circular progress bar to indicate model processing status.
- **Input Widgets**: Sliders and text inputs for user interaction.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize random data with graphs using Altair.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `streamlit`, `pillow`, `altair`
```bash
   pip install numpy pandas streamlit pillow altair

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
